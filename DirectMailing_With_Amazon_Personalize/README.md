# Direct mailing with Amazon Personalize

Many organizations perform direct mailings, designed to support fundraising or assist with other efforts to help further the organization’s mission. When an organization sends a direct mail piece to an individual, the piece typically contains a specific call to action–like contributing a donation or engaging with the organization’s cause.

Direct mailing workflows can use everything from a Microsoft Word mail merge to utilizing a third-party mailing provider. Regardless of the technology used, program administrators generate an address list and provide it to a system that generates mailings. By leveraging the power of the cloud, organizations can take advantage of capabilities that might otherwise be out of reach, like customized personalization at scale. Using personalization in direct mailing efforts can enhance the member experience and improve an organization’s return on investment when the right call to action is sent to the right member.
