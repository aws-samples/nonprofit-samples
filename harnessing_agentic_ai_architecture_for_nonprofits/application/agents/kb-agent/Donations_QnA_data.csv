Why is The Signatry transitioning funds from one sponsor to another?,We can operate more efficiently – and steward God’s resources better – by consolidating our fund operations into one fund sponsor. The Signatry Charitable Trust can receive the broadest range of gift types, making it the best option to serve as a single fund sponsor for all of The Signatry.,https://intercom.help/the-signatry/en/articles/8797033-fund-sponsor-transition-faqs
Is my fund moving away from The Signatry?,While funds are being transferred from one fund sponsor to another, all of the organizations involved are still a part of The Signatry. All funds will remain at The Signatry.,https://intercom.help/the-signatry/en/articles/8797033-fund-sponsor-transition-faqs
Why is The Signatry made up of two fund sponsors?,As a donor advised fund sponsor, The Signatry receives donations of both cash and noncash assets. Noncash donations (also called nonliquid gifts) can include gifts of real estate, business interests, and more. Many of these nonliquid gifts can best be received by a trust. The Signatry’s original fund sponsor organization (Servant Foundation) is a corporation, not a trust. As a result, The Signatry formed The Signatry Charitable Trust in 2018 to make it easier to accept a broader range of gifts.,https://intercom.help/the-signatry/en/articles/8797033-fund-sponsor-transition-faqs

For these people, there will be a three-week period during the transition when new grant recommendations will be on hold. Additionally, there will be a period during the transition when they will not be able to make any new contributions or new grant recommendations. We will notify affected individuals before these things happen. If the fund you advise was opened
