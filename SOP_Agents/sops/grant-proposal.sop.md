# Grant Proposal Executive Summary

## Overview

This SOP guides agents in writing executive summaries for grant proposals. The executive summary is often the first (and sometimes only) section that grant reviewers read, making it critical for securing funding. This procedure applies to all grant proposals submitted to foundations, government agencies, and corporate giving programs, regardless of funding amount.

## Parameters

- **problem_statement** (required): Clear description of the problem being addressed
- **problem_data** (required): Supporting statistics or data points (2-3 data points minimum)
- **organization_name** (required): Name of the nonprofit organization
- **organization_history** (required): Years of operation and track record
- **organization_credentials** (required): Qualifications and relevant experience
- **program_name** (required): Name of the proposed program or project
- **program_activities** (required): Specific activities and approach
- **target_population** (required): Who will be served (number and demographics)
- **expected_outcomes** (required): Measurable goals and impact
- **funding_amount** (required): Specific dollar amount requested
- **funding_period** (required): Time period the funding will cover

## Steps

### 1. Start with the Problem

Open with a compelling problem statement using supporting data.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST state the problem clearly and concisely because grant reviewers need to immediately understand what issue you're addressing
- You MUST include at least 2-3 specific data points or statistics because evidence-based problem statements are more compelling and credible
- You MUST make the problem relevant and urgent because funders prioritize pressing community needs
- If problem_data contains fewer than 2 data points, You MUST pause and request additional statistics before proceeding because insufficient data weakens the proposal
- You SHOULD use concrete, verifiable data
- You SHOULD connect the problem to the community or population served
- You SHOULD create emotional resonance while remaining professional
- You MAY include a brief contextual statement about why this problem matters now

### 2. Introduce Your Organization

Establish credibility using organizational background and qualifications.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST state the organization's name
- You MUST mention years of operation or relevant history because this demonstrates stability and experience
- You MUST highlight qualifications that demonstrate capability to address the problem because funders need confidence you can execute
- You MUST NOT exceed 2-3 sentences for this section because the executive summary must remain concise and the focus should be on the problem and solution
- You MUST NOT include unnecessary organizational details because this distracts from the core proposal
- You SHOULD include specific accomplishments or track record
- You SHOULD mention the population served or geographic area
- You SHOULD connect organizational mission to the stated problem

### 3. Describe the Solution

Explain the proposed program with specific activities and target population.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST name the specific program or project
- You MUST describe concrete activities and approach because vague descriptions don't inspire funder confidence
- You MUST specify who will be served with numbers and demographics because funders need to understand the scope and beneficiaries
- You MUST explain how the program addresses the stated problem because the connection must be explicit
- You SHOULD be specific about implementation details
- You SHOULD include timeframe or frequency of activities
- You SHOULD mention any innovative or unique aspects
- You MAY reference evidence-based practices or proven models
- You MAY mention partnerships or collaborations

### 4. State the Impact

Articulate expected outcomes with measurable goals.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST provide measurable, specific goals because vague outcomes cannot be evaluated
- You MUST connect outcomes directly to the problem statement because this demonstrates logical program design
- You MUST include quantifiable metrics where possible because funders need to assess potential return on investment
- If expected_outcomes lacks measurable metrics, You MUST pause and request quantifiable goals before proceeding because unmeasurable outcomes weaken the proposal significantly
- You SHOULD use concrete numbers (e.g., "80% of participants will...")
- You SHOULD specify how outcomes will be measured
- You SHOULD reference similar programs or evidence of effectiveness
- You MAY include both short-term and long-term impact
- You MAY mention evaluation methods

### 5. Include the Ask

State the funding request with specific amount and timeframe.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST specify the exact dollar amount requested
- You MUST state the time period the funding will cover because funders need to understand the investment timeline
- You MUST use clear, direct language
- You MUST NOT be apologetic or uncertain because this undermines confidence in your organization
- You MUST NOT include budget details because those belong in other proposal sections and would make the executive summary too long
- You SHOULD use a respectful, professional tone
- You SHOULD briefly mention what the funding will cover (if not already clear)

### 6. Review and Validate

Verify the executive summary meets all quality standards.

**Constraints:**
- You MUST confirm word count is between 250-500 words because executive summaries shorter than 250 words lack sufficient detail and those longer than 500 words lose the reader's attention
- You MUST verify all required parameters are included because missing information creates an incomplete proposal
- You MUST check that tone is professional and confident because uncertainty reduces funder trust
- You MUST ensure logical flow from problem to organization to solution to impact to ask because this structure is proven effective for grant proposals
- You SHOULD read aloud to check for clarity and flow
- You SHOULD verify all data points are accurate
- You SHOULD confirm jargon is minimized

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Grant Proposal Executive Summary

**Input Parameters:**
- problem_statement: "In our community, 1 in 4 children lack access to nutritious meals during summer months when school meal programs are unavailable."
- problem_data: "This food insecurity directly impacts their health, development, and readiness to learn when school resumes in the fall. Studies show food-insecure children are 90% more likely to experience developmental delays."
- organization_name: "AnyCompany Nonprofit"
- organization_history: "served low-income families in the Riverside neighborhood for 15 years"
- organization_credentials: "providing after-school programs, family support services, and emergency assistance to over 500 families annually"
- program_name: "Summer Meals Program"
- program_activities: "provide free, nutritious breakfast and lunch five days per week for 10 weeks during summer break, along with enrichment activities such as reading clubs, arts and crafts, and outdoor recreation"
- target_population: "200 children ages 5-12"
- expected_outcomes: "Based on similar programs in neighboring communities, we expect to serve 20,000 meals and prevent an average 5-pound weight loss per child that typically occurs during summer months. Additionally, 80% of participating children will maintain or improve their reading level, as measured by pre- and post-program assessments."
- funding_amount: "$45,000"
- funding_period: "June through August 2026"

**Output:**
```
In our community, 1 in 4 children lack access to nutritious meals during summer months when school meal programs are unavailable. This food insecurity directly impacts their health, development, and readiness to learn when school resumes in the fall. Studies show food-insecure children are 90% more likely to experience developmental delays.

AnyCompany Nonprofit has served low-income families in the Riverside neighborhood for 15 years, providing after-school programs, family support services, and emergency assistance to over 500 families annually. Our track record of community trust and program excellence positions us uniquely to address summer food insecurity.

We propose to launch a Summer Meals Program that will provide free, nutritious breakfast and lunch to 200 children ages 5-12, five days per week for 10 weeks during summer break. The program will operate at our community center and include enrichment activities such as reading clubs, arts and crafts, and outdoor recreation to prevent summer learning loss while ensuring children receive adequate nutrition.

Based on similar programs in neighboring communities, we expect to serve 20,000 meals and prevent an average 5-pound weight loss per child that typically occurs during summer months. Additionally, 80% of participating children will maintain or improve their reading level, as measured by pre- and post-program assessments.

We respectfully request $45,000 to fund the first year of this program, covering food costs, part-time staff, and program materials from June through August 2026.
```

### Example 2: Poor Executive Summary (What NOT to Do)

**Output:**
```
We need funding for our summer program. Many children in our area don't have enough food during the summer. Our organization has been around for a while and we do good work in the community.

We want to provide meals to kids and do some activities with them. This will help them stay healthy and learn. We think this is important and will make a difference.

Please consider funding our program. We need money to make this happen.
```

**Why this fails:**
- No specific statistics or data points
- Vague organizational credentials ("been around for a while")
- No specific program activities described
- No target population numbers
- No measurable outcomes
- No specific funding amount or timeframe
- Too short (68 words, below 250-word minimum)
- Unprofessional, uncertain tone

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Data or Metrics

If you don't have sufficient problem data or measurable outcomes, pause and ask the user for specific statistics and quantifiable goals. Explain that grant proposals require evidence-based problem statements and measurable outcomes to be competitive.

### Executive Summary Too Long

If your draft exceeds 500 words, focus on the most compelling data points and outcomes. Remove:
- Excessive organizational history
- Redundant descriptions
- Unnecessary adjectives
- Details that belong in other proposal sections

Aim for one concise paragraph per step (problem, organization, solution, impact, ask).

### Executive Summary Too Short

If your draft is under 250 words, you likely need:
- More specific data points in the problem statement
- Concrete program activity details
- Quantified expected outcomes
- Brief organizational credentials

### Tone Issues

If the summary sounds uncertain or apologetic:
- Remove phrases like "we hope," "we think," "maybe," "if possible"
- Use confident language: "we will," "we expect," "we have demonstrated"
- State the funding request directly without hedging

If the summary sounds too casual:
- Maintain professional language while being clear and direct
- Avoid slang or overly conversational phrases
- Use proper grammar and complete sentences
